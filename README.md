Maps can be accessed at [dbartles.github.io/WebMaps](https://dbartles.github.io/WebMaps/)

This is a collection of Web Maps created as part of the New Maps Plus program at the University of Kentucky in 2015/2016. I have forked it from my school account because I no longer have access to that account due to my school email account being inactive. 

Note: Most of these maps had broken links over time, but have recently been fixed with references to the latest API's. There is still link rot on the power plant map.
