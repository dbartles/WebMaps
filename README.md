Maps can be accessed at [dbartles.github.io/WebMaps](https://dbartles.github.io/WebMaps/)

This is a collection of Web Maps created as part of the New Maps Plus program at the University of Kentucky in 2015/2016. I have forked it from my school account because I no longer have access to that account due to my school email account being inactive. 

Note: Most of these maps had broken links due to link rot and expired tokens since they were built in 2016, but I am just now going through and fixing these issues in 2023.
